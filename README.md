## ‚úçÔ∏è Creating a New Post

Follow these steps to create a new post using the provided script:

### 1. Open Terminal or Command Prompt
Navigate to the root directory of the project.

### 2. Run the Script
Execute the following command, replacing `<foldername>` with the desired name for your post folder:
```bash
pnpm new-post <foldername>
```
For example, to name your post folder "what-is-angor", use:
```bash
pnpm new-post what-is-angor
```
This command will:
- Format the folder name to lowercase with hyphens.
- Create a directory with this name in `src/content/posts/`.
- Generate an `index.md` file within that directory containing initial post metadata.

### 3. Edit the `index.md` File
Open the newly created `index.md` file and start writing your post. Customize the frontmatter and add your content as needed.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Frontmatter of Posts

Each post file (`index.md`) should start with frontmatter in YAML format. Here is an example:

```yaml
---

published: 2024-05-08
description: This is the first post.
image: /images/cover.jpg
tags: [Bitcoin, Investment, Angor]
category: Cryptocurrency
draft: false
---
```

- `description`: A brief description of the post.
- `image`: Path to the cover image of the post.
- `tags`: An array of tags relevant to the post.

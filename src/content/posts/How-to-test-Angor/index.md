## Introduction to Angor Testing
 
Angor is a decentralized crowdfunding project leveraging the security of Bitcoin and the transparency of Nostr. Investors' funds are released in stages through time-lock contracts, and unspent funds can be recovered at any point (recovered funds may incur a penalty). Testing Angor involves verifying these processes and ensuring the platform works as intended.

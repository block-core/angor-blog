## Same Same but Different

### What Does Angor Mean?
Angor is a Latin word that means "anguish" or "distress." 
And that’s exactly what we’re trying to get rid of in crowdfunding.
For this, we have created **Angor Protocol** and **Angor Hub**.
They might sound like the same thing, but they serve different purposes. Let me break it down for you:

---

## What is Angor Hub?
Think of **Angor Hub** like a farmer’s market, where as a founder, you set up your own stall with your own produce (projects). And just like you, others have their stalls too, offering different opportunities.

**Angor Hub** is a marketplace where investors can find and invest in projects using **Nostr and Bitcoin technology** for security and transparency. 
A **safe haven** for Investors & Founders.

### How Investing Works on Angor Hub?
Let’s say **Mr. Scrooge**, a 50-year-old, with curly blonde hair from Switzerland, is looking for a project to invest in. He visits **Angor Hub**, browses through different projects (just like shopping on Amazon), and picks one that catches his interest.

Here’s how it works:
- **Angor Hub is a view-only platform** where investors can discover projects.
- Once Mr. Scrooge finds a project he likes, he uses the **inbuilt Angor wallet** to invest.
- **All investments happen peer-to-peer** between the founder and Mr. Scrooge, directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.
- **Angor does not hold Mr. Scrooge’s Bitcoin.**
- A **1% fee** is charged when using the **Angor wallet** to process the investment.
- All projects listed on **Angor Hub** use **Angor Protocol** to raise Bitcoin securely.

## What is Angor Protocol?
**Angor Protocol** is open-source software, free for anyone to **use, modify, or rebrand**. You can take the code, customize it, and put your own name on it.

> *Good artists copy. Great artists steal.* 😉 - Old Saying

In simple terms, a **protocol** is a set of rules that define how data or transactions are processed. Here are some of the rules of **Angor Protocol**:

- **Funds in a time-lock** are released automatically once the agreed-upon time period ends. Mr. Scrooge (investor) does not need to take any action for this to happen.
- If Mr. Scrooge wants to **exit the investment early**, he must actively **bail out**, but this comes with a **penalty**. This ensures commitment while still giving investors an option to withdraw.
- It allows for **peer-to-peer, on-chain transactions** without intermediaries.
- It integrates **Taproot** for privacy and efficiency, making transactions **more cost-effective**. *(More about this in the next blog.)*

## How Founders Use Angor in Real Life?

### **Scenario 1:**
**Mr. Piccolo**, a 30-year-old father of two from Thailand, discovered **gold beneath his home** and now has a promising **Gold Mining Project**. Seeing great potential, he seeks investors to bring it to life.

- To attract backers, he **lists his project on Angor Hub**, making it visible to potential investors.
- **Mr. Scrooge** comes across this project, likes it, and **signs a digital contract** with Piccolo directly on the Bitcoin blockchain.
- As the milestones are met, **the funds are automatically released** once the time-lock expires, following the rules set by the **Angor Protocol**. This ensures **security and fairness** without requiring manual approval from Mr. Scrooge.
- A **1% facilitation fee** is charged by **Angor Wallet**.

**Simple, right?**

---

### **Scenario 2:**
**Carlos**, a 21-year-old from Cuba, has a great **organic coffee export business** and wants investors to help him grow. But because of **international sanctions on Cuba**, he **can’t use normal funding methods** like bank loans, PayPal, or crowdfunding platforms.

- **Carlos lists his project on Angor Hub**, but because we, as a company, must follow legal rules, we may have to **delist his project** due to sanctions and restrictions in his region.
- But here’s the good part: **Angor Protocol is open-source and runs on Bitcoin**. This means Carlos can **still use it** to raise funds directly from investors like **Mr. Scrooge**.
- He gets the **security and transparency** of the protocol, even though **Angor Hub** can’t officially list his project due to regulatory constraints.

> **In short**, while **Angor Hub** has to follow regulations, the **Angor Protocol** itself is **open and permissionless**—anyone, anywhere, can use it freely. This openness ensures that people like **Carlos** can still access its benefits, no matter where they are.

## Will We Filter Projects on Angor Hub?
Yes. As **Angor Hub** grows, we may refine our **selection criteria** to ensure **quality and security**. But for now, our main focus is on **building a trustworthy space for both investors and founders.**

## What Happens if Mr. Piccolo (Founder) Has Started Mining Gold, but Mr. Scrooge (Investor) Doesn’t Release the Next Round of Funds?
This is a tricky situation. **We don’t have a central authority** to step in and fix disputes.

Say **Mr. Scrooge** is feeling confident about his investment. He **locks up 10 BTC for 10 months**, with **1 BTC released each month** to fund **Mr. Piccolo’s gold mining operation**.

Things start off well & after the first month, **1 BTC is unlocked**, and **Piccolo gets to work, pickaxe in hand**.

But then, **doubt creeps in**. Maybe the gold mine isn’t as promising as it seemed, or Scrooge just gets **cold feet**. What if he decides to **pull out the remaining funds**? 

He can do that, but **at a cost**. Bailing out early means **paying a penalty**.

### A Smarter Way to Handle This:
- **Tie fund releases to milestones.**
- Example: The next **1 BTC only unlocks** after Piccolo has already extracted some gold. That way, **progress drives the investment rather than just time.**

### The Challenge:
Without a **neutral third party** to enforce the agreement, **trust remains key**. Investors and founders need to be on the same page, setting **clear expectations before shaking hands**—virtually, of course.

### How We Safeguard Against Bad Actors:
- **Social pressure and reputation tracking.**
- Since **Angor uses Nostr** for communication, **Mr. Scrooge’s reputation** is visible to other investors and founders.
- If **Scrooge unfairly refuses to release funds**, it will **hurt his credibility**, making it harder for him to invest in future projects.
- **Piccolo can also publicly call him out**, discouraging unethical behavior.

## Conclusion
I hope you now understand the **difference between Angor Hub & Angor Protocol**. 
By **removing middlemen** and unnecessary fees, **Angor creates a trustless funding system**, where both **investors and founders take responsibility for their agreements**.

If you’re ready to **explore decentralized crowdfunding on Bitcoin**, check out **Angor Hub** or use the **Angor Protocol** to raise funds for your next project.

**Thank you and Good day y’all.**

**See you soon.**
